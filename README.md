You will also need to download the StanfordNLP and place it into the file where the package.json specifies.
You will need to download Nodejs and included it in your system path.
You will also need BaseX setup and to start it for operations.
From this point in your comandline navigate to the projects root folder. Run npm install and then npm run installation. Both of these will setup the proper node modules. 
Now all you need to do is run npm start which will start everything.
